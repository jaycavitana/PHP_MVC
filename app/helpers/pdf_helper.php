        <br>
        <b>Scope of Our Services</b><br>

        <br>
        Our professional fee for this engagement will be <b>PHP $professional_fee</b> inclusive of all applicable taxes, representation/out-of-pocket allowances, transportation fees, and other coherent expenses.<br>

        <br>
        The amount of our fee is based on the assumption that we will receive the information and assistance as detailed throughout this engagement letter.

        <br>
